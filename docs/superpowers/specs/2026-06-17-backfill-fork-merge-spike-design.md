# Spike: Icechunk worker fork/merge with virtual references

**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Issue:** [#12 — Refactor backfill processing to use partitioned fork and merge approach](https://github.com/developmentseed/virtualizarr-data-pipelines/issues/12)
**Status:** Spike complete (historical). The mechanics were graduated into production
code in sub-projects A and B; the disposable `tests/spike/` suite was removed. The two
proofs not otherwise covered — real cross-process `spawn` fork/merge and merge's
last-writer-wins overlap behaviour — were relocated to
`tests/backfill_mechanics/` (harness `mechanics_harness.py`). Paths below refer to the
original spike layout and are kept as-is for provenance. See Findings.

## Background

The pipeline currently ingests data by committing directly on `main`: SQS → `process_messages`
Lambda → one Icechunk commit per batch on `main`. This is fine for operational forward
processing, but for large backfills, scaling parallel workers creates a "thundering herd" of
rebase waits as workers contend for the `main` branch tip.

Issue #12 proposes a fork/merge backfill model: initialize the store at full shape on a
`backfill` branch, fan out many workers that each write a disjoint subset of chunk references
into independent Icechunk forks, then merge all forks into a single commit — maximizing the
writes-per-commit ratio and removing tip contention. Eventually this is orchestrated by AWS
Step Functions with a Distributed Map.

Before building any of that orchestration, we need to prove the **core Icechunk fork/merge
mechanics actually work** with VirtualiZarr virtual references and cross-process serialization.
That is the purpose of this spike.

## Goal

In a **local pytest harness** — with **real pickle round-trips** and **separate worker
processes** — prove the distributed fork → write → merge → commit cycle that issue #12 relies
on, before any Step Functions / Lambda / S3 / CDK work.

The spike is **disposable proof-of-mechanics code**. Its output is a passing test suite plus a
findings note that informs the real implementation design.

## Key facts established during design (icechunk 1.1.14, virtualizarr 2.2.1)

- `Session.fork()` → `ForkSession`; `Session.merge(*forks)`; `Session.commit(...)`. This is
  icechunk's documented distributed-write API.
- `ForkSession` is itself forkable (`ForkSession.fork()`) and mergeable.
- The icechunk docs describe — and this spike follows — the **coordinator** creating all forks
  from one `writable_session` and pickling them to workers. All forks must descend from the
  single session that later performs the merge; independently-created sessions cannot be merged
  together.
- **VirtualiZarr `to_icechunk` only supports `append_dim`, not `region`.** Appends mutate array
  shape and would conflict across forks, so we cannot use it for disjoint writes.
- **`IcechunkStore.set_virtual_ref(key, location, *, offset, length, ...)`** (and batch
  `set_virtual_refs`) places a virtual chunk reference at a *specific chunk key* in a pre-sized
  array — no append, so parallel forks touch disjoint chunks and merge cleanly. This is the
  disjoint-write mechanism.
- Branch management: `repo.create_branch(name, snapshot_id)`, `repo.lookup_branch(name)` →
  tip snapshot id, `repo.reset_branch("main", tip)` for promotion.

## Scope decisions (from brainstorming)

- **Spike, not full build.** De-risk fork/merge first; defer Step Functions infra.
- **Local pytest, real pickle round-trip**, workers in separate processes (`multiprocessing`
  with `spawn` to force genuine pickling).
- **Straight to virtual references** — mirror the real pipeline rather than prototyping with
  plain real-data region writes first.
- **Workers only — no partition concept in the spike.** A worker gets a disjoint subset of
  chunk indices (the real pipeline will size these via `MaxItemsPerBatch`).
- **The coordinator creates all forks** (one per worker) from a single `writable_session`,
  pickles each out to its worker, and holds that session in memory. Each worker writes its
  subset into its fork and pickles the fork back to a shared folder. Once all workers finish,
  the coordinator merges the returned forks into the same session and commits once. The reducer
  **discovers the returned forks by listing the folder** (mirrors a reducer listing an S3
  prefix), not via return values.
- **Include `main` promotion** via `reset_branch`.

## Model

```
Coordinator                                    Workers (separate processes)
-----------                                    ----------------------------
init_backfill_store(repo, N)
  create branch "backfill" off main
  create array foo, shape (N, y, x),
    chunk (1, y, x), BytesCodec, fill_value
  write source chunk bytes to local file
  commit "Initialize backfill shape"
  │
  session = repo.writable_session("backfill")   ← held in memory through the run
  split N chunk indices into W subsets
  for i in range(W):
    fork_i = session.fork()
    pickle.dump(fork_i, forks_in/worker_{i}.pkl)
  │
  ├── launch W worker processes ───────────►   fork = pickle.load(forks_in/worker_{i}.pkl)
  │                                            for t in subset:
  │                                              fork.store.set_virtual_ref(
  │                                                f"foo/c/{t}/0/0", location,
  │                                                offset=..., length=...,
  │                                                validate_container=False)
  │                                            pickle.dump(fork, forks_out/worker_{i}.pkl)
  │ wait for all workers
  ▼
  forks = [pickle.load(p) for p in list(forks_out/)]   ← discovery by folder listing
  session.merge(*forks)                                 ← same session that created the forks
  session.commit("Backfill commit")
  │
  ▼
  repo.reset_branch("main", repo.lookup_branch("backfill"))   ← promotion
```

## Components

All new code under `tests/spike/`. **No production code is touched.** (Function names below
reflect the final implementation; an earlier draft split the coordinator into
`make_forks`/`merge_and_commit`, but those were consolidated into a single `run_backfill`.)

- **`tests/spike/backfill_spike.py`** — helpers:
  - `open_repo(work)` — open the repo from `icechunk.local_filesystem_storage(...)` with the
    virtual-chunk-container config + authorization. Used by the coordinator. (Workers do **not**
    open the repo — confirmed by the spike; see Findings.)
  - `write_source(work)` — write the shared source file: one buffer per time step, value `t`, so
    chunk `t` lives at byte offset `t * CHUNK_NBYTES`, via `obstore`.
  - `init_backfill_store(repo, work)` — create `backfill` branch off the `main` tip, then on a
    `writable_session("backfill")` create array `foo` (metadata only) via
    `zarr.open_group(session.store).create_array("foo", shape=(N,Y,X), chunks=(1,Y,X),
    dtype=DTYPE, serializer=BytesCodec(), compressors=None, filters=None,
    dimension_names=("time","y","x"))`, and commit.
  - `run_worker(in_path, indices, source_url, out_path)` — the worker body, run in a spawned
    child process: `pickle.load` the coordinator-made fork, `set_virtual_ref` per index, pickle
    the fork to `out_path`. The worker does **not** open the repo or create a session — it only
    writes into the fork it was given.
  - `run_backfill(repo, work, subsets)` — the coordinator: open one `writable_session("backfill")`,
    fork once per subset and pickle each to `forks_in/`, spawn a `run_worker` process per fork,
    join (raising on nonzero exit), then discover the returned forks by listing `forks_out/`,
    `session.merge(*forks)` into the **same** session, and `commit(...)`. Returns the new tip.
  - `promote(repo)` — `reset_branch("main", lookup_branch("backfill"))`.
- **`tests/spike/test_fork_merge.py`** — the assertions (below).

### Storage and data shape

- Repo storage: `icechunk.local_filesystem_storage(tmp_path)` so child processes can resolve
  the same repo (mirrors an S3-backed deployment; in-memory storage would not survive process
  boundaries).
- Source chunk bytes: a single local file written via `obstore`, referenced through a
  URL-prefixed `VirtualChunkContainer` — the same pattern the existing synthetic processor
  uses. Each `foo/c/{t}/0/0` chunk points at that file with an `(offset, length)`.
- Array `foo`: shape `(N, y, x)`, chunk `(1, y, x)`, `BytesCodec`, dims `(time, y, x)` — one
  chunk per time step so each chunk index maps cleanly to one worker write.

## Verification

The spike is a real test, not a demo. Assertions:

1. **Full fork round-trip merges and commits.** Coordinator-made forks survive
   pickle-out → cross-process `set_virtual_ref` writes → pickle-back → discovery by folder
   listing → `merge(*forks)` into the original session → `commit()`, all succeeding.
2. **Read-back on `backfill`.** After commit, open `backfill` and assert every one of the `N`
   time slices resolves to the expected bytes/values, and no slice is missing/fill-valued.
3. **Promotion.** After `reset_branch`, `xr.open_zarr` on `main` returns the full `(N, y, x)`
   array, all slices correct.
4. **Characterization — overlap is NOT detected (last-writer-wins).** Two forks writing
   *different* content to the *same* chunk key merge and commit **without error**; the chunk
   ends up with whichever fork was merged last. This was confirmed during design with a scratch
   run (`merge` takes no conflict solver; icechunk's conflict detection happens during *rebase
   against a branch tip*, not when merging sibling forks off a shared base). The test asserts
   this behavior explicitly so the consequence is documented: **disjointness is the
   partitioner's responsibility — the merge provides no protection.** The real pipeline must
   guarantee non-overlapping chunk assignments per worker.

## Risks

The fork-ownership question is resolved by design: the coordinator creates all forks from one
`writable_session` and performs the merge against that same session — the documented icechunk
pattern. (Workers cannot independently create mergeable forks, since all forks must descend
from the single merging session.) So the spike validates a known-supported flow rather than an
open hypothesis; the remaining unknowns are mechanical and are what the spike confirms.

Confirmed during design (scratch run on icechunk 1.1.14 / zarr 3.1.5):

- The full happy-path cycle works: zarr-created full-shape array → coordinator forks → pickle
  round-trip → `set_virtual_ref` writes → `merge(*forks)` → `commit` → correct per-slice
  read-back → `reset_branch("main", ...)` promotion.
- `merge` performs **no overlap/conflict detection** for chunk writes (last-writer-wins) — see
  verification #4. Disjointness is the partitioner's responsibility.
- `local_filesystem_storage` logs a warning that it is not safe for *concurrent commits*. The
  spike only commits from the single coordinator (workers only `set_virtual_ref` on forks and
  never commit), so this does not apply — but the real S3 deployment should use an object store
  regardless.

Still to confirm in the spike proper (for the findings note):

- Whether a coordinator-made `ForkSession` round-trips through pickle intact across a
  `spawn`ed process, gets `set_virtual_ref` writes applied, pickles back, and merges into the
  original in-memory session.
- Whether `set_virtual_ref` requires the array metadata to pre-exist (expected yes) and whether
  `validate_container=False` is needed for the local virtual chunk container.
- Whether a pickled fork can resolve repo storage on its own in the worker process, or whether
  the worker also needs the repo/storage config available (informs how the real worker Lambda
  is packaged).

## Out of scope (deferred to the real implementation design)

- AWS Step Functions / Distributed Map orchestration.
- Lambda packaging and the init/worker/reducer handler split.
- Serializing forks to S3 (the spike uses a local folder as the stand-in).
- The partitioner over an inventory file / `MaxItemsPerBatch` sizing.
- CDK infrastructure changes.
- `VirtualizarrProcessor` Protocol redesign for region/ref writes.

The spike informs all of these but builds none of them.

## Deliverable

1. A passing `tests/spike/` suite implementing the model and all four assertions.
2. A short **findings note** appended to this spec (what worked, the merge-lineage answer,
   gotchas, and a recommended shape for the future `VirtualizarrProcessor` interface change)
   to carry into the real implementation design.

## Findings (spike results)

Implemented in `tests/spike/backfill_spike.py` + `tests/spike/test_fork_merge.py`
(6 tests, all passing) on icechunk 1.1.14 / zarr 3.1.5 / Python 3.13. Every claim below is
backed by an executable test, not a one-off scratch run.

- **Coordinator-creates-forks cycle works end-to-end across real processes.** A
  `writable_session` fork survives `pickle` → a `multiprocessing` `spawn`ed worker process →
  `set_virtual_ref` writes → `pickle` back → discovery-by-folder-listing → `merge(*forks)` →
  `commit`, and all `N` slices read back correct
  (`test_cross_process_fork_merge_commits_all_slices`). `reset_branch("main", backfill_tip)`
  then makes the data visible on `main` (`test_promotion_makes_backfill_visible_on_main`).
- **Workers need only the fork — not the repo.** The spawned worker (`run_worker`) calls
  `set_virtual_ref` on the unpickled fork without opening the repo or holding any storage
  config; it only needs the fork bytes plus the source `location`/`offset`/`length`.
  **Implication for the real pipeline:** the worker Lambda's payload is just the serialized
  fork (from S3) and the list of (chunk-key, source-URI, offset, length) refs to write — it
  does not need repo credentials or the storage/virtual-chunk-container config. Only the
  coordinator (init + reduce) needs full repo access.
- **`spawn` import works via propagated `sys.path`.** Keeping `backfill_spike` a top-level
  module (no `tests/spike/__init__.py`) plus the test's `sys.path.insert` lets the spawned
  child re-import the worker target. `spawn` (not `fork`) was used deliberately to force
  genuine pickling. In the real deployment the worker is a separate Lambda, so this importability
  concern disappears — but it confirms the fork carries everything needed across a process
  boundary.
- **Merge does NOT detect chunk overlap (last-writer-wins).** Confirmed by
  `test_overlapping_writes_last_writer_wins_no_conflict`: two forks writing different content to
  the same chunk key merge and commit with no error; the last-merged fork wins. icechunk's
  conflict detection is a *rebase-against-a-branch-tip* mechanism, not a sibling-fork-merge one.
  **Implication:** the partitioner MUST guarantee disjoint chunk assignments per worker; the
  merge provides no safety net. This is the single most important constraint for the real design.
- **Array creation:** `zarr.Group.create_array(..., serializer=BytesCodec(), compressors=None,
  filters=None)` on the session store produces a metadata-only array (`test_init_...` reads
  shape/dtype before any chunks exist); `set_virtual_ref` then populates chunks. Raw
  little-endian bytes via `BytesCodec` line up with the synthetic source file at
  `offset = t * CHUNK_NBYTES`. `set_virtual_ref` requires the array metadata to pre-exist, and
  `validate_container=False` was used for the local `file://` container.
- **Tooling gotcha worth recording:** the repo's pre-commit `mirrors-mypy` hook runs in an
  isolated environment **without `icechunk` installed**, so icechunk return types resolve to
  `Any` there. With `warn_return_any = true`, any function returning an icechunk call result
  typed `-> str` (e.g. `run_backfill` returning `session.commit(...)`) needs a `typing.cast`.
  This will recur in the real Lambda/handler code — expect to either `cast` or relax
  `warn_return_any` for icechunk-touching modules. (`uv run mypy` in the project venv does *not*
  reproduce this, since icechunk is installed there.)

### Recommended `VirtualizarrProcessor` interface direction (for the real build)

The current Protocol is append-oriented (`process_file(file_key, session)` →
`vds.vz.to_icechunk(session.store, append_dim="time")`). Backfill needs region/ref-oriented
writes instead. Suggested shape to validate during the real design:

- `initialize_backfill_store(repo, manifest) -> None` — create the `backfill` branch and the
  full-shape array(s) up front from a known global shape. The user must supply the total shape /
  coordinate extent (e.g. from the inventory), since the store can no longer grow by append.
- `plan_refs(file_key) -> list[ChunkRef]` (or similar) — map one input file to the explicit set
  of `(chunk_key, source_uri, offset, length)` virtual references it contributes, addressed by
  absolute index in the pre-sized array. This is the unit a worker writes via `set_virtual_ref`,
  and it is the contract the partitioner uses to guarantee disjointness.
- Keep the existing append-based path for the operational/forward-processing pipeline; backfill
  is an additional code path, not a replacement.

This keeps worker payloads small (just refs), makes disjointness checkable before dispatch, and
matches what the spike proved works.
